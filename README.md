# AxCore: Hardware Design & Functional Verification
目的：在Docker环境中，通过SBT工具，将Scala编写的硬件设计编译成Verilog，并进行功能验证

## Project Overview
This document outlines the hardware design and functional verification process for the AxCore project. The core is implemented using [SpinalHDL](https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/index.html), a modern, high-level hardware description language that facilitates efficient and flexible hardware design.



## Directory Structure
All project files are organized as follows:

* **SpinalHDL Source Code:** `hw/spinal/AxCore`
* **Verification & Testbenches:** `hw/spinal/AxCore/Testing`
* **Generated Verilog RTL:** `hw/gen/AxCore/` (This directory is created after running the generator)



## Environment Setup
### Recommended: Pre-configured Environment

We have prepared a ready-to-use development environment for you, which can be accessed via docker pull.

```bash
docker pull victorchan433/axcore-dev

docker run --rm -it victorchan433/axcore-dev /bin/bash

# After entered
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/CLab-HKUST-GZ/micro58-axcore-ae.git

# Navigate to the project's root directory
cd micro58-axcore-ae/Hardware/AxCore/
```



## Generating Verilog RTL

Follow these steps to generate the Verilog RTL from the SpinalHDL source code. The process uses SBT (Simple Build Tool) to compile the Scala-based SpinalHDL code and execute the generator.

```bash
# Launch the SBT (Simple Build Tool) interactive shell
cs launch sbt

# Within the sbt shell, compile the project's source code
compile

# Generate Verilog files for W4 configuration of the systolic array
runMain AxCore.SystolicArray_W4.AxCore_SharedAdd_MPWq4_SA_Gen

# Generate Verilog files for W8 configuration of the systolic array
runMain AxCore.SystolicArray_W8.AxCore_SharedAdd_W8_SA_Gen

# Wait for the "[success]" message, which indicates completion
```
The generated Verilog files can be found in the following output directory:
`hw/gen/AxCore/`.



## Functional Verification with Iverilog

To run the functional verification suite, you'll use the SBT environment to launch simulations. The testbench will report the DUT (Device Under Test) results and log a comparison against a golden reference model directly to your terminal.

### Running the Complete Test Suite
This command executes all verification tests in sequence.

```bash
# Make sure you're still in the sbt shell

# (Optional) If you've modified the source code, re-compile the project first
compile

# Run the complete functional test suite
runMain AxCore.Testing.OverallFunctionalTest
```

### Running the Individual Test Suite
The `OverallFunctionalTest` suite is composed of several independent test modules below. You can also execute these tests individually. Make sure you are inside the SBT shell before running these commands.

```bash
# Make sure you're still in the sbt shell

# 1. Test for Subnormal Number Conversion (SNC)
# Verifies the logic for handling subnormal floating-point numbers.
runMain AxCore.Testing.TestCases.Test_SNC_W4

# 2. Test for Mixed-Precision Floating-Point Multiplication Approximation (mpFPMA)
# Verifies the correctness of the approximate multiplication unit.
runMain AxCore.Testing.TestCases.Test_mpFPMA

# 3. Test for the 4x4 Systolic Array
# Verifies the core functionality of the systolic array dataflow and computation.
runMain AxCore.Testing.TestCases.Test_SA_4x4

# Tests are finished. To exit the sbt shell, type
exit
```
